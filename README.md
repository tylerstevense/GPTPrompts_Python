# :robot: ChatGPT Prompts

Welcome to the "ChatGPT Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/yokoffing/ChatGPT-Prompts/blob/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!

## Academic Essays

:bulb: You may need to double the number of pages you need. ChatGPT seems to underestimate page counts.

>We are going to write a `twelve` page graduate-level academic essay. 

>You must address the criteria below by writing at least `two` paragraphs for each point. Please also add subheading for each section. Do not write an introduction or conclusion.
>1) The assumptions and implications of `dialectical behavioral theory`. Identify assumptions and contrast and compare to one other theory. What is the vision for a good/healthy life, for example: What is considered normal or abnormal?
>2) As a clinical social worker, what are methods within the theory that are to be applied during the helping process? How do people change in this theory?
>3) How do relationships fit into this theory? These relationships include family members, friends, and the therapist.
>4) What are considered opportunities to apply this theory? Argue for and analyze limitations: Provide examples of the approach both when working well and examples of what it is not appropriate.
>5) What place in this theory is there for spirituality?
>6) How does this theory address issues of social justice?
>7) Identify limitations or issues pertaining to cultural competencies with this theory.

>Write a `one` paragraph **conclusion** of essay you've written.

>Now let's focus on an **abstract**, like one you would see in a peer-review journal. Remember: an abstract is different than an introduction. [An abstract is a short summary of a paper. An abstract serves multiple purposes: 1) an abstract lets readers get the gist/essence of your paper quickly; 2) an abstract prepares readers to follow the detailed information, analyses, and arguments in your paper; and 3) an abstract helps readers remember key points from your paper.](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/) Please write an abstract that is `one` paragraph and is at least `170` words in length. Include a list of at least `4` keywords at the end.
