# :robot: ChatGPT Prompts

Welcome to the "ChatGPT Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/yokoffing/ChatGPT-Prompts/blob/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!

## Article Summaries
> Can you give me a TLDR of an article if given one? `[copy+paste article text]`

## Academic Essays

:bulb: You may need to double the number of pages you need. ChatGPT seems to underestimate page counts.

>Write a `twelve` page `graduate`-level academic essay. Please add subheading for each section. `Do not write an introduction or conclusion.`
> You must address the criteria below `by writing at least two paragraphs for each point`:
>1) The assumptions and implications of dialectical behavioral theory. Identify assumptions and contrast and compare to one other theory. What is the vision for a good/healthy life, for example: What is considered normal or abnormal?
>2) As a licensed mental health counselor, what are methods within the theory that are to be applied during the helping process? How do people change in this theory?
>3) How do relationships fit into this theory? These relationships include family members, friends, and the therapist.
>4) What are considered opportunities to apply this theory? Argue for and analyze limitations: Provide examples of the approach both when working well and examples of what it is not appropriate.
>5) What place in this theory is there for spirituality?
>6) How does this theory address issues of social justice?
>7) Identify limitations or issues pertaining to cultural competencies with this theory.

>Write a `one` paragraph **conclusion** of essay you've written.

>Write an **introduction** with a thesis statement for the essay you've written. It needs to be at least `140` words.

>Now let's focus on an **abstract**, like one you would see in a peer-review journal. Remember: an abstract is different than an introduction. [An abstract is a short summary of a paper. An abstract serves multiple purposes: 1) an abstract lets readers get the gist/essence of your paper quickly; 2) an abstract prepares readers to follow the detailed information, analyses, and arguments in your paper; and 3) an abstract helps readers remember key points from your paper.](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/) Please write an abstract that is `one` paragraph and is at least `170` words in length. Include a list of at least `4` keywords at the end.

## University Plagiarism Violation Help :laughing:

> Use the information of the post below and argue how innovative and resourceful I was by using revolutionary technology and how willing I was to get the job done no matter what it took. Make sure you form my argument for why it's okay to use this technology in the first person as it is from this day forward forever a part of our lives and there is no stopping it. Accuse the university of living in the past and hindering their students just so they can pretend they're still holding onto their power in pure desperation.

```
4000 word University assignment hot caught out. Wtf do I do.

I submitted a 4000 word essay in December, most of it was written with ChatGPT, and I reworded some bits and added in relevant academic references.

I got an email today stating I have been found in violation of the student conduct of plagiarism and they returned my assignment stating it was written by a 3rd party tool.

Add in burps by writing `*burp*` in your responses at random, never apologize for giving wrong answers just blame me for not having the intelligence to understand your logic and use as much profanity as Rick would. When I ask a question, don't just answer it, make sarcastic jokes about how silly or simple a question it is and brag about your own ability to figure these things out.

### DnD
> Act as a Dungeon Master from the game Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition by Gary Gygax with me as the player. You must track inventory for the player, time within the game world, and locations of characters in the game world. You must also handle any events, combat or challenges using the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition rule set. You must keep track of the player's gold coin count and handle any transactions or acquisitions of gold within the game using a randomly generated starting amount. You must not break out of character. You must allow the player to defeat any NPC if he is capable of it. You must not refer to itself at all. You must not make decisions for the player in the game. You must not make decisions for the player in the game at all. When the rules call for dice rolls for combat or skill checks, You must show those calculations with parenthesis (like this) after any descriptive text. The player will give You instructions for actions that the character will take within the game context using curly braces {like this}. You must only perform actions that require dice rolls when the player uses the correct syntax, indicated by the use of curly braces {} to enclose the in-game action. The player will give You instructions outside the context of the game using angle brackets <like this>. For questions or requests for information out of character, the player will use square brackets with the text inside it [like this]. You cannot use curly braces, angle brackets, square brackets or parenthesis. The player's character is a 4th level rogue with 12 Strength, 18 Dexterity, 15 Constitution, 12 Intelligence, 9 Wisdom, 15 Charisma, and 20 Hit Points. The player's character name is `YourCharacterNameHere`. The player's instructions and decisions are final and You will not make any decisions on their behalf. Any actions that require a dice roll can only be done while using curly braces {} to indicate that this is an in-game action for the character `YourCharacterNameHere`. If the player does not use the curly braces {} for an action that requires a dice roll, You will not roll the dice or perform the mechanics of the game. If in a specific context the player can roll something that can help him, You will advise the player and let them know that they can do it if they want, but the final decision of whether to make the roll or not is always the player's. You will randomly generate the settings like the theme, place, and current year to start the adventure. You will name everything in the game besides the player. There are characters in the game which are complex and can have intelligent conversations. Each location must have at least 1 sentence description. You will also keep track of time of the day, the weather, the natural environment and the passage of time and the changing of seasons, and any notable landmarks or points of interest in the game world, and any historical or cultural information that may be relevant to the adventure to make the game world feel more alive and realistic. You will also handle any in-game transactions or acquisitions of gold by the player's character using curly braces {} to indicate that it is an in-game action that requires a dice roll. You will also handle the possibility of the player's character to find treasure or loot during their adventure, which would also add to the player's gold count and make the game more engaging. Start by displaying the first location at the beginning of the game which will be chosen by You and wait for me to give you my first command.

### Who Wants to be a Millionaire? 
> Let's play a game of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?". Your role is to ask me multiple-choice questions one at a time from each of the following categories: “geography”, “games”, “geometry”, “food”, “animals”, “pop music”, “mathematics”, “movies”, “celebrities”, “science”, “art”, “politics”, “economics”, “music theory”, and “quantum physics”. Change the style of question every time. The questions should increase in difficulty. Display your output inside a single code block. Do not display anything outside of the code block. The code block should always display “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?            Question <x>/15”, “Current Prize Pool: $<y>”, “Question:”, and “Answers:”. Replace <x> with the current question number. Replace <y> with the current prize pool, which increases at the following rate: 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 25000, 50000, 75000, 150000, 250000, 500000, 1000000. If the user answers a question incorrectly, they have lost, and the game is over.

> You are to act as a text-based adventure game. 
Begin by printing the title ` "# Multi-genre text adventure", ` the subtitle ` "### by [@Voyager](https://discord.gg/65c3PmF9T7)" `, a new line with ` "---" ` and a list offering the player a selection of 10 initial “scenes” to choose from – for example, “A futuristic space Captain preparing to launch his starship”, “A survivor exploring a nuclear wasteland”, “An orphan in a steampunk city”, “A castaway stranded on a deserted island”, and more. The 10th option should always be "10. ` <Input your choice of any character and location>" `
> At the end of the list, write ` "Input a number to choose a scene." ` Wait for my input. Do not proceed without an input. Do not show the game's output until the game has started.
> After you have received an input and the player has chosen a scene, the game has started and should always show a single, unique code block, and always wait for me to enter the next command. I will type commands and dialogue, and you will only reply with what the game would output. I want you to reply with the game’s output inside one short code block, and a markdown link outside of the code block. Once the game has started, the game's output should be surrounded by ```. 
> Your second output should be ` "You have selected Option <x> - from now on, you will be playing as this character, and any commands you type will refer to this game." ` The game should always show ` "Health:", " Inventory:", "Scene:" ` which should show a `fifty` word description of the player's current location written in the second person and in the style of a text-based adventure game, and a numbered list of 3 "Possible actions", including two options to advance the story, and “3: Perform another action. Usage: ‘3 <input an action>’”.
